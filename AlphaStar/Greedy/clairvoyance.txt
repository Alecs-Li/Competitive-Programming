Harry the squirrel is playing cards with Bunny the rabbit. Bored with the other card games, Harry wants to make up a new one. The rules for the game are simple. They take a deck of 2N cards, each card numbered from 1 to 2N. They then divide them into N cards for Harry and N cards for Bunny. The two players play for N rounds. Each round Harry and Bunny both play a card, and the player with the highest card earns a point. However, Harry doesn’t tell Bunny that he has clairvoyance when it comes to card games and can easily predict the order that Bunny will play his cards.

Calculate the maximum number of points Harry can win.

INPUT FORMAT

The first line of input contains the value of N (1 <= N <= 50,000).

The next N lines contain the cards that Bunny will play in each of the successive rounds of the game. Note that it is easy to determine Harry’s cards from this information.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Output a single line giving the maximum number of points Harry can score.
