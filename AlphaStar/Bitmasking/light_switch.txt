Nila is in charge of 20 light switches. The switches can either be on or off. She wants all switches to be off. However, when she flips a switch, she must flip that switch and also the switches on either side of the wall (for a total of 3 flips, or if it's an end switch, 2 switches). Given the initial state of the switches (1 = on, 0 = off), what is the minimum number of switches to turn all the switches off?


INPUT FORMAT

* Line 1: A single line with 20 space-separated integers

OUTPUT FORMAT

* Line 1: The minimum number of switches necessary for all the switches to be off (i.e. to 0). A solution is guaranteed to exist.
