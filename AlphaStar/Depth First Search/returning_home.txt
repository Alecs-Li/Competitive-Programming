Henry has spent a long day at the carnival, and now he must return home. Unfortunately, he is lost and cannot find his way. 

Henry has a map with R roads (3 <= R <= 5,000), conveniently numbered 1..R. The carnival is located at road 1. Henry’s house (denoted as H ( 2 <= H <= R) is located at the end of the road H which is accessible from the carnival. Roads are all the same length, and each one leads to a fork where Henry has a choice as to which road he takes. No road appears as the fork from more than one road, and the map contains a total of NS forks (1 <= NS <= 5,000).

It is getting dark, so Henry wants to know how far away from home he is and which roads he must take to get home. 

Consider the map below. Road numbers are given, and the intersection between 3 roads represent the forks in the road. Henry’s home is located at the end of road 6: 

           

Henry must cross roads 1, 3, 5, and then 6 to get home, giving a total distance of 4 (which is simply equal to the number of roads he crosses). 

The input file includes a set of lines, each with a road number N (1 <= N <= P) and the two roads (B1 and B2; 1 <= B1 <= R; 1 <= B2 <= R) that branch off from it. Some lines will include road 1 and its two branches.

Give Henry the directions home.
