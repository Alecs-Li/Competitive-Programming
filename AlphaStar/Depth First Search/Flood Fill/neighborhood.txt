Neighborhood
Sam has N shipping containers (1 <= N <= 10,000) in his warehouse. If we think of the warehouse as a 100 x 100 grid of 1 x 1 square cells, each shipping container takes up one cell on its own.

Sam notices that his shipping containers form one large connected region, meaning that from each container, one can reach any other container by going north, south, east, or west onto an adjacent container. The region may contain “holes”, or empty regions that are surrounded completely by shipping containers.

Help Sam determine the perimeter that his configuration of shipping containers form. Note that the holes are not part of the perimeter. 

INPUT FORMAT

Line 1: An integer N.
Lines 2..1+N: Each line gives the (x,y) location of a container, (1 <= x, y <= 100). Position (1,1) is the lower-left cell in the warehouse, and position (100,100) is the upper-right cell.
